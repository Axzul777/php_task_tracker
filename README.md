# TASK CLI MANAGER

## Overview
TASK CLI MANAGER is a simple command-line task management tool. It aims to help users create, update, and delete tasks efficiently. However, it's still a work in progressâ€”sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Feel free to try it out and see how it performs!

## Features
- No external libraries each thing on native php
